Come as a friend-stay as family-take pleasant memories. Our newly constructed place is ten kms away from Shoghi in a village called KOT. Don’t u worry about getting here as we will be ur guide (means don’t rely on Maps when u leave the highway), call us and we will accompany u in our small mini car (Hitakshi does have a license). Love Nature? Hiking? Village life? This is ur place. Love City life? I've heard Mumbai is Great.\n\n\nBefore you book I must stress that it is a quiet village area far away from city’s hustle bustle (When you are coming from Chandigarh, 13Kms before Shimla comes a small station called Shoghi, from Shoghi you take a link road to reach Kot, which is 10kms away). Although it will be a unique experience for anybody, but those who want to stay and enjoy the city life of Shimla, this place won’t suit your temperament. But one night halt to see how it goes won’t be a bother (as it is, it’s not that expensive).\n\nOur newly constructed place has three spacious bedrooms (around 300sq ft carpet area), each with connected bath and toilet and a separate private entrance. Each room also has a connected balcony for you to enjoy the view of the valley, and for those among you who are trying to quit smoking this will be the place for deciding while smoking. Mostly all the basic amenities are provided including Cable-TV and electric heaters during winters. It may not be luxurious but is definitely clean and complimenting to a simple village life. I am afraid we don't have Wi-fi but most of the phone networks work just fine. Two nice wooden cushioned chairs with a round table in between, are nicely placed by the bay window for you to enjoy your morning and evening tea.\n\nI am sure you will enjoy simple home cooked food made with love by my Granny. Spicy and non-spicy is for you to say. Oh! By the way, we are Vegetarians, and Yes-not even egg. Apart from that whatever you want to eat just inform us in advance. I would recommend that you try our Signature Himachali Cuisines.\n\nNOTE** Breakfast is charged @150/- INR per person.\n\nNOTE** Lunch and Dinner is charged @200/-INR per person.\n\nNOTE** Linens will be changed after every two days.\n\nNOTE** Washing & Ironing of clothes available @30/-INR per piece\n\nNOTE** If it gets dark when you reach Shoghi, I would strongly advice for you to call us, not that it gets unsafe, but the internal link roads can be confusing. And specially the last 40 mtrs stretch, which is unpaved and can easily skip one’s eye.\n\nNOTE** Visual directions are also provided in the photographs.\nShow more","location":"Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India","_id":38},{"rooms":[{"guests":6},{"bedrooms":3},{"beds":4},{"bathrooms":3}],"amenities":["Wifi","Kitchen","Heating","Free parking"],"title":"Mystica - 3BHK luxury apartment, Mashobra, Shimla","subtitle":"Entire rental unit in Mashobra","rating":4.67,"reviews":6,"images":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-52021565/original/e80111a0-c161-481e-bfd3-2513a2c060f3.jpeg?im_w=720","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/59383f13-6af4-48b2-9c7b-a1f1b43f732c.jpg?im_w=720","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-52021565/original/2cb61aae-341f-4c07-a8ec-dd380d38dff8.jpeg?im_w=720","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-52021565/original/9ccb4696-2779-43f8-a66f-6805b2f56809.jpeg?im_w=720","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/miso/Hosting-52021565/original/c878b057-7678-4b95-9d3d-dba5e8637f1e.jpeg?im_w=720"],"price":12882,"description":"Lavish living experience in a private 3 BHK luxury apartment, having breathtaking 180 degree panoramic views of Shimla, Kufri, and Naldehra.\nLocated amidst the peaceful residential neighborhood of Mashobra, our home is a splendid escape 10 Kms away from the commercial craziness of Shimla, at just 8 hours drive from Delhi, 3 hours drive from Chandigarh.
