Plan for the searchbar : 

On the frontend : 
let searchParams = new URLSearchParams({ hotel : 'sth', place : 'something'}).toString()

On the backend you'll just get all the parameters in req.query, and you can just consume them and send data
forward. If we need a better processing API, we'll make it. 


Filterbar plan (before executing this, take into consideration where we are getting our data from and all of that).

If the data is on the frontend, then we can just filter it directly instead of repetitive fetching

If the data is not on the frontend, which it likely won't be because we'll implement pagination, we will need a 
fetch-based way of getting the data, as well as updating the view immediately. 

I think just changing the search query is an effective way, and that delegates the filter work to the backend

On the frontend and backend, we'll have to plan the search properly.

When the query is changed, we need to show a spinner until our query is loading (we have a hook for this)




Filterbar is not filtering. Do something about this.                done
  Make actual filter URLs after deciding on a common format w Karan

Replace the airbnb string with ashray

Pagination 
Main hotel page
  + Reviews
  Book hotel option (like a side widget maybe, see Arundhati's website)
  Add to wishlist

Search functionality
Change the airbnb thing, make it different
Scrape data again if you have time

Prepare the requirements list for the backend

  /hotels
  /hotels/id    Give data for a specific hotel with reviews
  PUT /wishlist
    {hotel : _id}
  GET /wishlist
  POST /book
    {hotel : _id}
  POST /login
    {username : ___, password : ___}
  POST /auth/google
  POST /auth/facebook
  POST /signup
  GET /logout
  /search/name='sth'&place='Jamshedpur'&price='<2&>4'
    - Decide the formatting for the search string, and make a quick parser 
    - See if there is a quick way to encode and decode objects to url strings, 
    which will make us able to skip the former step. 


Filterbar (to do when time is free) : 

What is our problem ?
We need to filter things based on what the user has chosen.
1. We need to decide, how to filter things, since we have 2 different kinds of filters, one is a button, other is a slider
   a. Easy. Just decide based on the filterOptions property
   b. Filteroptions property is incomplete, we will need to pass both the state variable and the function to change it
   c. Now what do we do with the state variable ? We could use it to filter.
      i. What does this mean ?
